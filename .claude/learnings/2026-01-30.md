## [12:56] Bead bd-n1a - Create GitHub repository and push initial code

**Approach:**
Used `gh repo create` command with organization flag to create repository directly in JacobMagesHaskinsContrast organization. Used `--source .` and `--push` flags to push existing local commits in one step.

**Challenges:**
- Agent mail (`am`) command interface was different than expected, skipped registration for now
- None otherwise - straightforward repository creation

**Learnings:**
- `gh repo create ORG/REPO` syntax works directly for organization repos
- Can combine repository creation and initial push with `--source . --push` flags
- Repository topics can be added post-creation with `gh repo edit --add-topic`

**Code Patterns Used:**
- `gh repo create` for GitHub CLI automation
- `gh repo edit` for metadata configuration

**Would Do Differently:**
- Nothing - workflow was smooth
