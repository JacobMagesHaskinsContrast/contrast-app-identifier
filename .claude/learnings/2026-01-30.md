## [12:56] Bead bd-n1a - Create GitHub repository and push initial code

**Approach:**
Used `gh repo create` command with organization flag to create repository directly in JacobMagesHaskinsContrast organization. Used `--source .` and `--push` flags to push existing local commits in one step.

**Challenges:**
- Agent mail (`am`) command interface was different than expected, skipped registration for now
- None otherwise - straightforward repository creation

**Learnings:**
- `gh repo create ORG/REPO` syntax works directly for organization repos
- Can combine repository creation and initial push with `--source . --push` flags
- Repository topics can be added post-creation with `gh repo edit --add-topic`

**Code Patterns Used:**
- `gh repo create` for GitHub CLI automation
- `gh repo edit` for metadata configuration

**Would Do Differently:**
- Nothing - workflow was smooth

## [13:23] Bead bd-j3j - Add integration tests for MCP connections

**Approach:**
Created comprehensive integration test suite covering MCP server connections. Discovered and fixed critical import error in mcp_tools.py during test development.

**Challenges:**
- Initial implementation used wrong import path: `pydantic_ai.tools.mcp` doesn't exist
- Had to investigate Pydantic AI's MCP support and find correct API: `pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerStdio`
- Changed from MCPToolset API to MCPServerStdio which is the correct interface

**Learnings:**
- Pydantic AI v1.50.0 supports MCP via `pydantic_ai.mcp` module, not `pydantic_ai.tools.mcp`
- MCPServerStdio is the class for stdio-based MCP servers
- Integration tests should gracefully skip when external dependencies (npx, docker) aren't available
- Use `pytest.mark.skipif` with `os.system()` checks for dependency validation
- UBS warnings about assert statements in tests are false positives (standard pytest practice)
- UBS B605 subprocess warnings when NOT using shell=True are also false positives

**Code Patterns Used:**
- pytest-asyncio for async test execution
- pytest fixtures for test configuration and temporary paths
- Proper async context management with `asyncio.wait_for()` and timeouts
- Test organization with multiple test classes for different concerns

**Would Do Differently:**
- Check API documentation more thoroughly before initial implementation
- Could have discovered the import error earlier by running a simple import test
